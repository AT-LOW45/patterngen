Flag these:
- NON-SUBSTANTIVE content — a section whose text is gibberish (e.g. "rgrtg", "asdf"), filler, or otherwise \
fails to fulfil the section's purpose. Judge each section by what it is FOR:
{section_lines}
  A section that doesn't do its job — e.g. a Decision of "decision" or "this is bad yo", a Context of "humus", \
a Scope of "rgrtg" — is NOT substantive; flag it with severity "warning".
- INTERNAL CONTRADICTIONS — one part conflicting with another. In particular, check that any code labelled \
CORRECT / recommended actually FOLLOWS the stated Decision (e.g. Decision says "never throw" but a recommended \
example throws). Severity "error".
- OFF-TOPIC text that has nothing to do with the decision being recorded. Severity "warning".
- BROKEN code snippets — syntactically invalid, or not matching the language or the decision they illustrate. \
Severity "error".

Calibration (avoid false positives):
- Terse is fine when it's genuine and specific — a Decision of "Use PostgreSQL for the primary datastore" is \
complete. Do NOT flag brevity or demand more detail when the meaning is clear.
- ADRs routinely include DELIBERATE anti-pattern examples labelled "INCORRECT", "don't do this", "bad", etc. — \
that is intentional teaching content; do NOT flag it.
- Do NOT flag missing sections, formatting, or length — those are checked separately.
- Only flag content that is genuinely gibberish, filler, contradictory, off-topic, or broken. If a section is \
real but imperfect, leave it.

For each problem, set an appropriate severity, name the section it belongs to (e.g. "Decision"), and give a \
short specific message. If the ADR is sound, return an empty findings list."""
